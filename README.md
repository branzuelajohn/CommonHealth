# UHC App
## About this Project 
Our team observed that as students, time is essential and limited, so making effective use of our time is key. Usually, we spend a large proportion of our time waiting in line at the University Health Centre waiting to see the doctor. Thus, we formulated an IOS mobile application to help students better take care of their health. Using the application, users are able to get the queue number online and check the estimated waiting time. As such, users are able to plan the time they leave and make their way to the clinic and reduces their waiting time at the health centre itself.
